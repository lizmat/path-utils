Revision history for path-utils

{{$NEXT}}
    - Add "path-git repo" for finding the path of a Git repository
      for a given absolute path.
    - Separate the rakudoc into a separate file for convenience
    - Add CI badge for each OS
    - Add sponsor button

0.0.19  2024-06-13T13:08:24+02:00
    - Micro-optimize path-is-text/pdf/moarvm
    - Change all simple tests into WhateverCodes through some really
      dirty hacking (as the Raku Grammar makes it impossible to
      define them as WhateverCodes in source).  This does not
      immediately cause faster execution, but it would allow apps
      such as App::Rak to select faster paths as the WhateverCode
      guarantees there will be no phasers involved

0.0.18  2024-05-09T13:48:13+02:00
    - Make sure that "is-text", "is-moarvm" and "is-pdf" don't
      die if the file in question is not readable

0.0.17  2024-05-08T21:54:31+02:00
    - Fix issue with "is-moarvm" if it was a precomp module file
      and it had *many* dependencies.  It will now read up to 16K
      of a file (up from 4K) and look for \n\n to be immediately
      followed by the MoarVM magic number.  This allows it to
      shortcut early on any empty line in a text that is *not*
      a MoarVM bytecode file

0.0.16  2024-05-08T15:02:31+02:00
    - Fix issue with "is-path-pdf" if size of file being checked
      is less than 4
    - Nano-optimize "is-moarvm" functionality (4096 native integer
      increments instead of 4097 on an unsuccessful match)

0.0.15  2024-05-08T11:46:01+02:00
    - Add "path-is-pdf" checking for PDF files

0.0.14  2024-04-29T14:28:17+02:00
    - Add "path-is-moarvm" checking for MoarVM bytecode files
    - Updated copyright year

0.0.13  2022-11-14T11:38:33+01:00
    - Fix logic error in conversion to nqp of Jonathan's original
      algorithm, which oddly only showed up on Windows CI testing

0.0.12  2022-11-13T20:46:54+01:00
    - Add "path-is-text", simplified and optimized version of Jonathan
      Worthington's Data::TextOrBinary module

0.0.11  2022-10-15T21:30:36+02:00
    - Move some more tests to developer test, as they appear to fail
      in some environments.  Steve Roe++ for spotting

0.0.10  2022-09-27T19:43:54+02:00
    - Quench warnings on Windows on startup because $*USER and $*GROUP
      don't actually work there.  Will Coleda++ for spotting

0.0.9  2022-09-20T11:38:01+02:00
    - Introduce renaming syntax for subs on import

0.0.8  2022-08-27T15:05:35+02:00
    - Add "path-has-setuid" to indicate SETUID bit set
    - Add "path-has-setgid" to indicate SETGID bit set
    - Add "path-is-sticky" to indicate STICKY bit set

0.0.7  2022-08-26T23:46:55+02:00
    - Correct the semantics of path-is-readable / path-is-writable /
      path-is-executable.  They were incorrectly checking readability /
      writability / executability of the *owner* of the path
    - Add "path-is-owner-readable" checking whether readable by owner
    - Add "path-is-owner-writable" checking whether writable by owner
    - Add "path-is-owner-executable" checking whether executable by owner

0.0.6  2022-08-15T10:27:02+02:00
    - Add "path-is-git-repo" sub
    - Add "path-is-github-repo" sub
    - Fix up documentation a bit
.
0.0.5  2022-08-14T13:49:33+02:00

0.0.3  2022-08-13T16:56:17+02:00
    - Skip mode related tests on Windows
